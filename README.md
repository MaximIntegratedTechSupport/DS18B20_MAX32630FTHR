# DS18B20_MAX32630FTHR
This repository contains 2 PC GUI programs that configure the temperature alarms and the resolution of a single [DS18B20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/DS18B20.html).  Each program interfaces to the DS18B20 through the [MAX32630FTHR](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/microcontrollers/MAX32630FTHR.html) board with the "Raw One Wire Interface" firmware loaded.
The GUI connects through a USB cable to a MAX32630FTHR (FTHR) board which has the “Raw 1-Wire Interface” firmware loaded on it. If the customer has an unprogrammed MAX32630FTHR, he/she will need to load the firmware before running the GUI.  The firmware is available as a free download here:  https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/MAX32630FTHR_Raw_One_Wire_Interface. <p>

The GUI programs are:
- **DS18B20_Config**.  This program is meant to help a user understand the sequence of 1-Wire commands to read and write the part. It offers 3 input fields for the high alarm, low alarm and resolution.  It also contains a "Write Config" button, a "Read Config" button, and an output text box. To use: the user inputs the configuration bytes in the appropriate input fields and clicks the "Write Config" button to write the configuration to the part.  The output of each 1-Wire command step is output to the textbox. To read, the user simply clicks the "Read Config" button and each 1-Wire step is similarly output to the text box.
- **DS18B20_Custom**.  This program is meant to be a simple device programmer.  It has a single input box to hold the three configuration bytes, with only a "Write Config" button. When the button is clicked, the three config bytes are written to the part and read back immediately for verification purposes.
